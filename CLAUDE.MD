Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or
configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means
you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve
library id and get library docs without me having to
explicitly ask.

##CODING Practices
Ensure each feature delivered has testing to accompany it to ensure that future updates do not impact current functionality. 
Ensure all code is commented per best practices. 
Update CLAUDE.MD as needed.
